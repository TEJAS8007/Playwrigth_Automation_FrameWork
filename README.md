A robust, scalable, and maintainable end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework built with Playwright, designed for cross-browser testing, video recording, and Allure reporting.

📌 Features
Cross-Browser Testing: Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Video Recording: Captures video for each test execution.

Allure Reporting: Generates detailed and interactive test reports.

Page Object Model (POM): Enhances code reusability and maintainability.

Environment Configuration: Utilizes config.json for managing environment-specific settings.

Logging: Implements logging using Winston for tracking test execution details.

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 1,
  reporter: [['list'], ['allure-playwright']],
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    video: 'on',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  },
  projects: [

🧪 Running Tests
Run all tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx playwright test
Run tests with UI:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx playwright test --ui
Run a specific test file:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
Generate and view Allure report:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx allure generate --clean
npx allure open
📹 Video Recording
Test execution videos are saved in the videos/ directory. Each video corresponds to a test run, aiding in debugging and analysis.

📊 Allure Reporting
Allure provides interactive and detailed test reports. After running tests, generate the report using the commands mentioned above. The report includes test steps, attachments, and execution history.

🧱 Page Object Model (POM)
The framework follows the POM design pattern, encapsulating page elements and actions within classes located in the pages/ directory. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.

📝 Logging
Logging is implemented using Winston. Logs are stored in the logs/ directory, capturing information such as test execution details, errors, and warnings.
